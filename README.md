# Impact Trade File Analysis

## Project Overview

Impact Trade File Analysis is an advanced, multi-engine risk management system that leverages various methodologies, including QUIC (Quasi-Independent Calculation) and Acadia, along with Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide comprehensive risk analysis and insights across multiple financial instruments, with a focus on FX Swaps and Forwards. It combines a powerful Python-based backend for trade data processing, risk metrics calculation, and predictive analytics with a user-friendly Next.js frontend for data visualization and interaction.

## Objective

The primary goal of this system is to provide financial institutions with a state-of-the-art tool for analyzing and comparing risk calculations from different risk engines (currently QUIC and Acadia) for various financial instruments, with a particular emphasis on FX Swaps and Forwards. By implementing multiple risk methodologies, Machine Learning techniques, and LLMs, the system offers a more comprehensive, accurate, and insightful approach to risk assessment and comparison.

## Key Features

### Backend (Python)

1. **Multi-Engine Risk Calculation**:
    - Implements risk calculations using both QUIC and Acadia methodologies
    - Allows for easy comparison between different risk engine outputs
2. **FX Trade Data Processing**:
    - Focuses on FX Swaps and Forwards
    - Capable of handling other financial instruments for future expansion
3. **Comprehensive Risk Metrics Calculation**: Computes a wide range of risk metrics for each risk engine, including:
    - Potential Future Exposure (PFE)
    - Mark-to-Market (MTM) Value
    - Value at Risk (VaR)
    - Expected Exposure (EE)
    - Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE)
    - Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)
4. **Machine Learning Integration**:
    - Utilizes Decision Trees for risk classification and prediction
    - Implements One-Hot Encoding for categorical data preprocessing
    - Develops predictive models for market movements and risk factor analysis
5. **LLM-Powered Insights**:
    - Leverages Large Language Models to generate narrative insights and explanations of complex risk scenarios
    - Provides natural language querying capabilities for risk data
6. **Historical Data Integration**: Utilizes real market data for accurate simulations and calculations
7. **Database Integration**: Stores all processed trades and calculated metrics in a PostgreSQL database for easy retrieval and analysis

### Frontend (Next.js)

1. **Multi-Engine Dashboard**: Provides an overview of key risk metrics and comparisons between QUIC and Acadia calculations
2. **Advanced Trade Explorer**: Allows users to view, filter, and analyze FX Swaps and Forwards transactions
3. **Risk Engine Comparison**: Interactive tools to compare and analyze differences between QUIC and Acadia risk calculations
4. **Interactive Risk Visualization**: Dynamic charts and graphs to visualize various risk metrics over time and across different risk engines
5. **Counterparty Analysis**: Tools to assess and compare risk exposure across different counterparties
6. **ML-Powered Scenario Analysis**: Enables users to run sophisticated what-if scenarios, leveraging ML predictions for more accurate forecasting
7. **LLM-Driven Reporting and Insights**: Generates customizable reports with narrative insights, explaining complex risk situations and engine differences in natural language

## Technology Stack
